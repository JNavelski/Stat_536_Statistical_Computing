## What can R Markdown do?

\section{Compile Code}

1) It can compile r code.

```{r}


x = seq(0,1,by=.01)
y = x^{2}
y[1:10]

```

```{r, fig.width=3,fig.height=3}

hist(y) ##histogram of 7

```

\section{Compile math }

In line with math $y=x^{2}$ and display math is two dollar signs, e.g.

$$y = mx+b \\
  y = x^{2}
$$

\section{Equation arrays}

\begin{eqnarray}
(a+b)^{2}&=&(a+b)(a+b) \nonumber \\
&=& a^{2}+ab+ab+b^{2} \nonumber \\
&=& a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}
\end{eqnarray}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
